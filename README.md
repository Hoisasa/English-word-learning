## Key Features

It's a flashcards application which organises words into quite small groups for easier memorisation. 
It aims to help beginner english learners whose native language is russian. 
There are three modes Overview Practice and Exam. 
While overview just straight up shows the translation others provide it after pressing a designated button. 
We don't put a goal of checking your typing speed or pronunciation thus it's your responsibility to evaluate the answer. 
In the end all mistakes are shown as so to provide you with a feature to reflect on your answers. 
To gauge the progress of learning each word they have points assigned to them. 
When you are ready - complete the exam: a more strict area which punishes mistakes more. 
The exam aims to get you as close to perfect score as possible. 
But in order to not be utterly strict it allows one mistake to be completed

The features of an app are as follows:
- Only one part of speech per group, less confusion
- Groups consist of subgroups
- Mostly just 10 words per subgroup
- self evaluation
- it aims to show beginner how words meanings can vary depending on context 
- target learner language russian
